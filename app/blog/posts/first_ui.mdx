## Platform Development

We are excited to share the progress on the development of **Housepital Care**, a next-generation **home healthcare platform** designed to bridge the gap between healthcare facilities and patients' homes. Built using **Streamlit** for rapid prototyping and real-time data interaction, the platform provides a user-friendly interface for remote patient monitoring, telemedicine, and personalized healthcare.

The platform is supported by a modular backend infrastructure that integrates **FastAPI** for building efficient APIs, **MySQL** for reliable data storage, and **phpMyAdmin** for database management.

To ensure scalability, security, and easy deployment, we've containerized the entire application using **Docker**, which allows for consistent environments across development, testing, and production. **Nginx** has been used as a reverse proxy to handle incoming traffic, providing optimal performance and security.

This architecture enables us to offer innovative healthcare solutions, ensuring patients can receive continuous care remotely and access vital health information from the comfort of their homes.
