## Overview

This phase focused on building **Housepital Chat**, a generative AI assistant designed for healthcare-related conversations. The platform is publicly accessible at [chat.housepitalcare.com](https://chat.housepitalcare.com/) and leverages modern full-stack technologies with secure authentication, large language models, and scalable infrastructure—all deployed in a Dockerized environment on AWS EC2.

## Key Features

- **Next.js (TypeScript) Frontend**: Built a responsive web app using the App Router and modern React architecture, providing an intuitive UI for interacting with the chatbot.
- **Google Gemini API Integration**: Integrated Google's generative language model to enable medical-related conversations, assistant support, and general-purpose AI responses.
- **NextAuth Authentication**: Implemented secure login with support for multiple providers, including email and Google, to ensure controlled access to the platform.
- **ShadCN UI**: Used the ShadCN component library for consistent, modern UI elements and developer productivity.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Managed user sessions and chat logs using a relational database with strong integrity guarantees.
- **Adminer Interface**: Provided a lightweight interface for database management and monitoring.
- **Dockerized Architecture**: Containerized the entire application stack (Next.js, PostgreSQL, Adminer, and Nginx) using Docker Compose for a reliable and consistent development environment.
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Configured Nginx to proxy requests, serve the frontend on port 80, and handle SSL setup for domain-based access.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js + TypeScript**: For building the frontend and API routes with modern web standards.
- **NextAuth.js**: For handling secure user authentication and session management.
- **Google Gemini API**: To power the chatbot's language understanding and response generation.
- **PostgreSQL + Adminer**: For data persistence and admin-level DB access.
- **Docker + Docker Compose**: For encapsulating and managing services across environments.
- **Nginx**: As a reverse proxy and static server for public access via domain name.
- **AWS EC2**: To host and deploy the entire system with public DNS and domain configuration.

## Challenges and Learnings

Deploying a full-stack AI application required careful coordination between frontend design, authentication flow, API rate limits, and server reliability. One of the major learnings was optimizing Gemini API requests to maintain performance while preserving context. Orchestrating services inside Docker and configuring Nginx for domain-based access taught valuable lessons in DevOps and scalable deployment.

## Outcome

**Housepital Chat** successfully launched as the organization's first generative AI platform and has become a foundation for future healthcare AI tools. It demonstrated end-to-end development capability—from UI to AI integration to DevOps—while providing a real-world deployment experience using cloud infrastructure. The project is now accessible at [https://chat.housepitalcare.com](https://chat.housepitalcare.com) and continues to evolve with user feedback.
