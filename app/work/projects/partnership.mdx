## Overview

This phase focused on expanding Housepital Care’s impact through international collaboration, specifically by partnering with nursing homes and caregiver providers in Singapore. The objective was to validate Housepital Care’s features in different care environments, gain international user insights, and explore regional scaling opportunities.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Border Collaboration**: Initiated partnerships with eldercare facilities and caregiver networks in Singapore to pilot Housepital Care’s digital tools.
- **Localized Caregiver Tools**: Adapted self-assessment and stress tracking modules based on feedback from Singaporean caregivers, ensuring cultural relevance and ease of use.
- **International Knowledge Exchange**: Facilitated discussions and feedback loops with care staff abroad to refine health education content and feature prioritization.

## Challenges and Learnings

Navigating regulatory differences, cultural nuances, and language variations was essential when designing tools for caregivers in a new country. We learned that while caregiving challenges are similar across borders, user expectations and communication styles vary — requiring flexible product design and localized onboarding strategies.

## Outcome

This collaboration marked Housepital Care’s first international engagement and helped strengthen the product’s global adaptability. Insights gathered have directly influenced upcoming feature updates and laid the groundwork for further regional partnerships and market entry opportunities.
