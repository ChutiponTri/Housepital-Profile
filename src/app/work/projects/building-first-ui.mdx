## Overview

This phase involved the creation of the very first prototype UI for Housepital Care, developed using Streamlit for rapid iteration and real-time data interaction. The platform was built using a modular backend infrastructure that combined FastAPI, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin—all containerized using Docker to support development efficiency and deployment consistency.

## Key Features

- **Streamlit Frontend**: Implemented a minimal, interactive web interface that allowed healthcare professionals and internal users to visualize caregiver records and interact with basic dashboard tools.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Built a RESTful API layer using FastAPI to handle authentication, user submissions, and retrieval of caregiver data in real-time.
- **MySQL Database**: Structured and stored caregiver logs and metadata in a relational format, allowing for efficient queries and scalability.
- **phpMyAdmin Interface**: Used phpMyAdmin for visual monitoring and quick administrative access to the MySQL database during development.
- **Dockerized Architecture**: Packaged all services into Docker containers, streamlining setup, ensuring cross-platform compatibility, and simplifying CI/CD integration.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Streamlit**: For building the initial lightweight UI with rapid prototyping capabilities.
- **FastAPI**: To create a performant backend API for communication between frontend and database.
- **MySQL + phpMyAdmin**: As the main relational data store with GUI support for DB operations.
- **Nginx**: To perform reverse proxy from port 80.
- **Docker**: To containerize and manage all services for local development and deployment.

## Challenges and Learnings

Balancing fast prototyping with structured backend design was a major challenge. While Streamlit enabled quick iterations, integrating it with a production-grade backend required strict API design and clear data models. Managing multi-container orchestration and persistent storage in Docker also provided deep insight into infrastructure management early in the project.

## Outcome

This project laid the groundwork for the Housepital Care platform’s technical foundation. It enabled early-stage user testing, validated data handling pipelines, and established a dev environment that could scale into future versions. The initial system served as both a proof-of-concept and a launchpad for future frontend evolution using frameworks like Next.js and React.
