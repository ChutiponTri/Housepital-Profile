## Overview

This phase focused on connecting directly with caregivers in both formal and informal settings to test early versions of the Housepital Care platform. The goal was to gather raw insights on usability, emotional needs, and care workflows—especially from frontline users who often lack structured support.

## Key Features

- **On-Site Interviews & Trials**: Conducted hands-on demos and interviews with family caregivers, nurses, and care volunteers in community clinics and home care visits.
- **Feedback-Driven Iteration**: Adjusted features like symptom journaling, emotional tracking, and health reminders in real-time based on immediate caregiver feedback.
- **Trust Building**: Developed simplified onboarding flows and conversational UI components to build trust among digitally inexperienced caregivers.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was building rapport with caregivers who were initially skeptical of digital health tools. Many preferred personal interaction over app-based care. We learned that empathy-driven communication, culturally familiar language, and minimal interfaces were crucial in encouraging adoption.

## Outcome

This phase gave us invaluable ground-level insights and helped shape a user experience rooted in empathy and simplicity. We uncovered patterns in caregiver stress, decision fatigue, and care documentation habits—insights that now inform both design priorities and partnership strategy.

It demonstrated that direct engagement with caregivers—not just institutions—was critical for meaningful impact. This outreach approach validated the relevance of our tools in real-world caregiving, guiding us toward deeper product-market alignment and more inclusive tech design.
